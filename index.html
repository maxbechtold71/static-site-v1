    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Max Bechtold, and I am a sophomore at the University of Minnesota studying Technical Writing and Communication (TWC)
        as well as Philosophy. My TWC subplan is Information Technology & Design, and I am also working towards a German minor.<br>
        <br>
        I work as a part-time barista at Rustica Cafe and Bakery in Minneapolis, and have been there since September of 2020.
        My favorite drink is pretty standard: the regular latte. <br>
        <br>
        In my free time I enjoy taking long walks, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and learning new songs
        to play on piano. <br>
     </p>

    <h2>My First HTML Website</h2>

      <p> Although learning to code in a new language is intimidating, I've found it very entertaining to work with HTML and
        CSS to create this website. With enough coding practice and a desire to learn new things about technology, I think
        anyone can become a great programmer! <br>
        <br>
        Learning about technology, especially computers, has been something I have wanted
        to do for a while, but before this semester I didn't have much confidence. <br>
        <br>
        This year, I aim to keep gaining skills with technology so that I can apply them to my career and everyday tasks.
        I have already learned a lot simply from my first three weeks creating C++ programs and diving into the world of
        web programming. With each day I program, I feel like I get even better at formulating my ideas into code. This
        tells me that programming is a learn-by-doing skill, and that mastery takes patience and resilience. The feeling
        of your program working exactly as you intended, however, is well worth the moments of frustration.
