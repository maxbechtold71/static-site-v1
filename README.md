# Static Site v1
First draft of my personal portfolio website. The initial draft is meant for the assignment in WRIT 4662W, but I plan to use this as a way to create a portfolio website in the future.
The site includes a home page, an "about me" section, a link to my LinkedIn, and a pdf of my Resume (address and contact information excluded). 

## Version 1.1 Update
Added substantial responsivness features to enhance the viewing experience on different screen resolutions and devices.
