        <h2>My Journey</h2>

          <p>I grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota and started attending the University of Minnesota in fall of 2019.
            I alwyas had an interest for writing. In high school, I was a journalist for my school
            newspaper, and I mainly wrote on political issues. I also was the captain of my school's swim team, which
            I still have fond memories of to this day. Since high school, I have had a strong passion for explaining
            things to people and teaching them. I enjoy helping people learn complex ideas and concepts, which is why
            I joined the TWC program in my freshman year of college. I also have a passion for seeking answers to the
            great questions of life, especially about knowledge and society.<br>
            <br>
            I specifically am interested in courseware development because of my passion for teaching and explaining, as well
            as my growing interest in information technology. I believe that today's digital environment is fast-paced and
            many people could use help catching up. Not only would I love to teach these people about how to use technology
            efficiently and effectively, I would also like to use my own technology and writing skills to make instructions
            and tutorials that communicate these ideas to my audience. <br>
          </p>

        <h2>What are my Skills?</h2>

          <p>Through my university courses and my work experience, I have gained many skills that make me a great candidate
            for a technical writing and courseware development team, such as:<br>
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Digital Literacy and Competency</li>
              <li>Leadership</li>
              <li>Problem solving</li>
              <li>Critical thinking and analysis</li>
              <li>Time management</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Some "harder" skills that I have are:<br>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Document, web, and information design</li>
            <li>Working proficiency in German</li>
            <li>Object-oriented programming</li>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>Written communication</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>My Goals for this Semester and the Future</h2>

        <h3>Practice with Technology</h3>

          <p>One of the things I hope to do this semester is gain a lot of knowledge about computers and digital technology. This is
            something that I will be working on for the rest of my time at college, but it has to start small. I hope to work at least
            1-2 hours per day practicing these types of skills. This might include doing homework for courses that involve coding, tinkering
            around with various tools, or even setting up my own environment for creating large projects. Since practice holds a
            lot of importance in learning about digital technology, I aim to spend a lot of time on this. <br> </p>

        <h3>Gain Resources for Self-Learing</h3>

          <p>I desire to become more familiar with learning resources and where they exist outside the University of Minnesota. I won't be
            at the University forever, so creating an environment for self-learning will help me gain new skills outside of the formal
            academic setting. Already, I have gained a lot of knowledge about where to look. Online technology courses are becoming more
            popular, and in creating this website alone I have seen countless resources for HTML learning. Gaining the discipline and patience
            to teach myself is also another challenge to overcome. Learning by yourself takes much more self-motivation than having a teacher or
            professor assign things for you.<br> </p>

        <h3>Become a Better Technical Communicator</h3>

          <p>At the heart of each of my goals is technical communication (TC). TC surrounds my practice with technology and
            my learning resources because of my future as a technical communicator and the simple fact that my learning processes use
            TC in various ways.
            Learning resources are always going to be oriented towards TC in some sense. Whether they use technology
            to communicate, explain highly technical concepts, or use common practices in TC, they relate to my personal and
            professional life through their methods and nature. <br>
            <br>
            With technology permeating our everyday lives, thinking like a technical communicator gives me an advantage in learning
            about digital technology. Since I joined the TWC program, I have thought more critically about what I learn through the media,
            the University, and the internet. I often ask myself the question of what the rhetorical goals of these things are, and whether
            they meet mine. This allows me to find ways to improve in everyday communication and in more advanced settings.<br>
            <br>
            Thinking like a technical communicator helps me learn more because I have a more clear view of how I learn and how I explain to others.
            Becoming a better technical communicator is not just about learning the technical content and becoming familiar with technology, but also
            about reflecting upon these aspects in a humanistic way and adapting to their constantly changing environments.<br> </p>
